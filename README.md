# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project assignment

# Overview:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  The data used for this project can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

When the run_analysis.R script is run, the following will happen:

1. The data set will be downloaded and unzipped to your working directory.

2. The script will merge the training and test sets into a single data set.

3. The variables are renamed for increased readability.

4. The activity identifiers are renamed to reflect the name of the activity.

5. The script will create and write to file an independent tidy data set which contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

Information about the variables from the tidy data set can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
